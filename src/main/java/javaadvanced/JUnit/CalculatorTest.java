/**
 * With JUnit, you can create test classes and methods to verify the behavior and correctness
 * of individual units of code, such as methods, classes, or modules.
 * It provides a set of annotations, assertions, and test runners that enable developers to
 * write and execute unit tests in a structured and automated manner.
 * JUnit also supports advanced features like test fixtures (@Before, @After) for setting up
 * and tearing down test environments, parameterized tests for running the same test with different
 * input values, and test suites for organizing and executing multiple test classes
