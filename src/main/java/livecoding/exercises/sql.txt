Step 1: Create a Table
We will create a table called "orders" to store information about customer orders, including order ID, customer ID, order date, and order total. Additionally, we'll add some constraints to ensure data integrity.
Step 2: Create a Customers Table (Dependency)
To handle the foreign key constraint, we need a "customers" table that stores customer information.
Let's create that table as well:
Step 3: Insert Data into the Customers Table
Let's add some sample customer data:
Step 4: Insert Data into the Orders Table
Now, we'll insert some orders into the "orders" table. Note that the customer IDs in the "orders"
table must exist in the "customers" table due to the foreign key constraint.
